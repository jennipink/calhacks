"""
This is for CalHacks 2016.

Using IBM's Watson APIs, we plan on creating either a: 

1) social media platform that stores and evaluates all the text/data submitted by the user on the platform, or
2) Google Chrome extension that takes in all the text/data submitted by the user on a certain platform

that allows the user to:

1) self-evaluate his or her own personality, and
2) self-diagnose possible underlying social/mental issues.
